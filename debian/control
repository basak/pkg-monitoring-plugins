Description: Plugins for the nagios network monitoring and management system
 Nagios is a host/service/network monitoring and management system. It has
 the following features:
 .
  *  Monitoring of network services (via TCP port, SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP,
     PING, etc.)
  *  Plugin interface to allow for user-developed service checks
  *  Contact notifications when problems occur and get resolved (via email,
     pager, or user-defined method)
  *  Ability to define event handlers to be run during service or host events
     (for proactive problem resolution)
  *  Web output (current status, notifications, history, log file, etc.)
 .
 This metapackage will install the entire suite of plugins for nagios.
 If you are installing nagios plugins on a remote "satellite" server
 (using nagios-nrpe-server or nsca), you may be interested in the
 nagios-plugins-basic package.

 This package provides a basic set of plugins with minimal external
 dependencies.  It is not likely to be useful by itself unless you are
 installing a remote "satellite" server (using nagios-nrpe-server or nsca,
 for example).
