nagios-plugins for Debian
================================================================================

below is a collection of various bits of information that might be
helpful to users of nagios-plugins in debian.

================================================================================
how to use plugins
================================================================================

- you can invoke the plugins with "--help" to get help how to use the plugins
- a short usage can be usualy obtained by just running the check without
  arguments
- if you need more informations, how to use plugins, have a look at:
  http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/plugins.html

================================================================================
different plugin packages and how to avoid installing massive dependencies
================================================================================

if you're frustrated by all the crap being brought in by nagios-plugins (for
example if you're installing nrpe or nsca on a remote host), try the
nagios-plugins-basic package.

================================================================================
plugins needing root privilege
================================================================================

the check_dhcp and check_icmp plugins require root privileges to
run, because of the low-level packet mangling that they perform.
but, in the interest of the "safe default", these plugins will not
be installed with the suid bit set.  there are two recommended ways
about overriding this on your system:

- set the suid bit with dpkg-statoverride:

# dpkg-statoverride --update --add root nagios 4750 $plugin

where $plugin is the specific plugin you want to grant such privileges.

- use sudo to grant the permissions and modify your plugin config

of these two, the first is recommended because it's the simplest and
has the same effect as the second.
