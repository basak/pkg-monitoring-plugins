nagios-plugins (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Sean Finney:
    - now managing nagios-plugins as part of the pkg-nagios alioth project.
    - updated Maintainer field
    - updated build-dependencies to build against libsnmp9-dev
    - removed build-dependencies on exim4 | mail-transport-agent, ssh, fping,
      qstat, smbclient, and ntp stuff.  instead they are all have their
      paths hardcoded into the build-process via dpatch file
      10_config.h_debiandefaults.dpatch (closes: #312333, #297708).
    - added config option for ssmtp
    - upstream is now accidentally deleting the check_ldaps plugin
      during the build-process.  whoops.
    - removed unneccesary dpatch 09_pssyntax, massaged 08_subst.dpatch
      into shape with new upstream version.
    - added check_mysql_cmdlinecred to allow parsing of credentials on
      the cmdline (closes: #314913).
    - looks like the issue with check_load was previously resolved by
      guido (closes: #305351).
    - nagios and nagios-plugins no longer need to use update-nagios, as nagios
      can natively scan /etc/nagios-plugins/config now:
      (closes: #325893, #321939).
    - i believe check_ldap's config is now correct (closes: #305720).
    - removed references to check_nmap, which is generally superceded
      by check_tcp.  it still exists in the contrib directory of the
      source, which may at some point be put in /usr/share/doc for those
      who really want it (closes: #319997).
    - include de.po patch from jens seidel (closes: #313960).
    - upstream fix: all of the plugins should now be properly setting
      locales, so problems like commas for decimal seperators should no
      longer break plugins for people in certain locales:
      (closes #312228, #306244, #308458, #327212, #316882).
    - upstream fix: check_ntp now supports zero offset (closes: #276794).
    - upstream fix: divide by zero check for check_swap (closes: #328603).

    who found out the solution. (closes: #232300)

    is not so terrible
